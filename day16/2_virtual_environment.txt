-We may have different projects that may require different package dependencies.
-Your project1 may have pandas version 2.1 whereas project2 may have pandas version 2.5 in the 
 same system.So, this aries a problem. If you want to work on project1 then one of packages
 must be uninstalled from your global system and another version should be installed.

-This problem can be solved creating a virtual environments in your system.
-Virtual environment is an isolated environment to keep the packages required for your project.
-It solves the problem of installing and uninstalling packages for different projects in a same system.

-Every python project must be done with a virtual environment activated.

- Commands for Virtual Environment:

1.python -m venv <environment_name>
  => this command creates a new virtual environment(for this session let's say "venv")

2. venv\Scripts\activate (for windows device enter this command in command prompt)
   source venv/bin/activate (for mac and linux devices)
   => this command activate Virtual Environment
3. deactivate
  => it deactivates the virtual environment
4. pip freeze
  => it displays all the packages installed in the environment

5. pip freeze > requirement.txt
  => Add all the dependencies of the project in requirement.txt file

6. pip install -r requirement.txt
  => Recursively installs all the packages in the virtual environment
