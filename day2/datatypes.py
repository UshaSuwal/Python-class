###Datatypes###
#like in other programming languages python has also its own datatypes:
#1. Numbers (immutable)
#2. Boolean  (immutable)
#3. List     (mutable)    [ ]
#4. Tuple.   (immutable)  ( )
#5. Dictionary  (mutable)
#6. Set        (mutable)
#7. String      (immutable)

#except number and boolean, other datatypes are sequencial.
#sequencial datatypes: list, tuple, dictionary, set, string

#####immutable and immutable objects#####
# if an objects once created can be altered in its life period then it is mutable datatypes.
# egs of mutable objects are list, dictionary, string
# if an objects can never be altered then it is immutable datatypes
#egs of immutable objects are tuple, string

#egs
a=[1,2,3]
a[1]=7
print(a)  # a will be changed as a is list and it is mutable
b=(1,2,3)
#b[1]=7  error will occur as b is tuple and it is immutable
print(b)



# 3 things must be kept in mind while studying datatypes
#1. operators
#2. methods
#3. built-in function
